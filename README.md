# What Am I Reading?

We see a connection between Fake news and cybercrime in the realm of Social Engineering.
Social Engineering is the manipulation of individuals in order to get them to divulge information or
perform some action to the advantage of the manipulator. Fake news and AI generated articles
can be used by cybercriminals to influence targets and create an atmosphere from which further
attacks and exploits can be performed. There were several prior papers published in similar areas
of research, such as the increased threat of dis/misinformation and Deep-fakes as there have
been significant advancements in Generative AI, and potential methods which could be
employed to mitigate the risks. The cost of ignoring the risks are too great: we’ve seen examples
of what happens when misinformation campaigns are applied in order to influence public political
opinion, both at peace and during wartime. A recent example of the dangers of misinformation is
the Brazil 2018 election and the misinformation which went viral through encrypted messaging
apps, which resulted in radical protests resembling the United States January 6th incident.

Large Language Models (LLMs) in particular present a sophisticated challenge because of their
ability to create grammatically-correct lengths of text based on the analysis of other writing. An
example of this is the lawyer who submitted a brief containing precedents which did not exist, but
were merely “hallucinated” by ChatGPT. If a malicious actor were to use a LLM, he could easily
create fake articles and documents to spread mis/disinformation. What is specific to our research
is looking at the disinformation capabilities of LLMs in the form of fake news, which has been
previously studied using controllable language models and observing the same models which
generate fake news can be used to detect fake news.

Using these prior works as a baseline for detection of fake-news, the research question we will
answer is: “Can we accurately train a classifier to detect the difference between AI-generated
versus human generated news?”
